# Purpose

The purpose of this organization is to host unmaintained plugins. We will act as an intermediary to finding a plugin for a new maintainer. We will not maintain these plugins - this is a safe, temporary ownership assignment. We've noticed that plugins may result in having multiple iterations, like when `nest-cam` became unmaintained, `nest-cam2` came around. We are trying to prevent this situation from arising as it becomes confusing for users as to which version is the most up-to-date.

## For Users

Any plugins hosted here are NOT affiliated with the Homebridge project. We are not the authors or maintainers of any plugin here. These plugins may still work, but we are not responsible for supporting or maintaining them. We are simply holding ownership until someone offers to keep these plugins. Any issues created on these repositories will most likely go unanswered. We may be able to address matters regarding security advisories for dependencies.

## For Developers

If, for any reason, you can no longer maintain your plugin, please reach out to the Homebridge collaborators on Discord or open an issue at:

- https://github.com/homebridge/unmaintained-plugins

Essentially you transfer ownership over to this organization, and we will give you admin access to your plugin's repo. You can still continue to maintain on an irregular basis if you so choose. However, the assumption will be made that you are no longer committed to the plugin. We will hold onto the plugin and if someone comes along and requests to become the new maintainer, we will transfer ownership over to that person. However, we can request that you (the original plugin author) still be given admin access.
