# Purpose
The purpose of this Organization is to host unmaintained plugins. We will act as an intermediary to getting a plugin a new mainainer. We will not be maintain these plugins, this is a temporary ownership assignment. We noticed in the past it has become necessary for plugins to have multiple interations such as once nest-cam became unmaintained nest-cam2 came around. We are trying to prevent this situation from arising as it becomes confusing for the end users as to which is the most up to date version

## For Users
Any plugins hosted here are NOT affiliated to the Homebridge project. We are not the plugin authors or maintainer. All plugins here are not being actively maintained. These plugins may still work but we are not responsible for supporting them or maintaining them. We are just holding ownership until someone offers to maintain these plugins. Issues created on these repositories will most likely go unanswered. The only issues that may be answered is matters regarding security advisories for dependencies.

## For Developers

If you plan on no longer maintaining your plugin please reach out to the Homebridge collaborators Team on Discord or open an issue at the [unmaintained plugins repo](https://github.com/homebridge/unmaintained-plugins). Essentially you transfer ownership over to this organization, we will then give you admin access to your plugin's repo. You can still continue to maintain on an irregular basis if you so choice. However, the assumption will be made that you no longer have any commitment to the plugin. We will hold onto the plugin and if someone comes along and requests to become the new maintainer we will transfer ownership over to that person but request that you the orginal plugin author still be giving admin access.
